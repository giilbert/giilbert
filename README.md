<p>I'm a software developer and student at <b>Stony Brook University</b> studying computer science.</p>
<p>
In my free time, I enjoy making things and exploring learning random topics in math and CS. Some things I'm into are <b>Linux, backend development, and systems programming.</b>
</p>

Some things that I'm well familiar with are:
- 🖼️ Making websites with <b>HTML/CSS/JS</b> as well as tools/frameworks like <b>React</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, and <b>TailwindCSS</b>.
- 💽 Building backends with <b>Node.js</b> (Express & Hono), <b>Python</b> (Django/Flask), <b>PostgreSQL</b>/<b>MySQL</b>/<b>SQLite</b> (with ORMs like Drizzle and Prisma) and <b>Docker</b>.
- ⚙️ Architecting system-level code with <b>C/C++</b> and <b>Rust</b>
